# CMSC-128---Lab-1
Here is the repository for CMSC 128 Lab 1, which includes a booking website's front end and back end.

Regarding the porgram:
* Arranges the client's stay at a resort
* Manages the reservation list to prevent conflicts with clients' stays
* Provides a summary of the reservation list for a given time period
* Permits clients to change the kind of stay they desire
* Used for transaction, such as figuring out how much each stay would cost

Disclaimer:
* The algorithm does not specifically identify a customer and only examines each transaction
* To better explain this, the database is more like a record of receipts
* We are not interested in identifying the number of times the same customer had book their stay
* This will be further discuss during the live demonstration
